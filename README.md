# CycleDiffusion: Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Are Image-to-Image Editors via Inferrring "Random Seed"

## Note
1. Paper will be arxived soon. 

## Overview
We think the randomness in diffusion models is like magic! Accumulated evidence has shown that fixing the "random seed" helps diffusion models generate images from two image distributions with minimal differences. Our paper is exactly about **how to formalize this "random seed"** and **how to infer it from a given real image**. 

Our formalization and derivation are purely by definition, while we show that some amazing consequences follow! This repository contains code for **CycleDiffusion**, an embarrassingly simple method capable of

1. Zero-shot image-to-image translation with text-to-image diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion. 
2. Traditional unpaired image-to-image translation with diffusion models trained on two related domains.

Check our results on zero-shot image-to-image translation below! We formulate the task input as a triple $(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{t}, \hat{\boldsymbol{t}})$:

1. $\boldsymbol{x}$ is the source image, displayed with a purple margin.
2. $\boldsymbol{t}$ is the source text, with text spans marked in purple.
3. $\hat{\boldsymbol{t}}$ is the target text, with text spans abbreviated as $[\ldots]$ if overlapped with the source text.

We used [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) in our experiments. Notably, all source images $\boldsymbol{x}$ are **real images**! Yes, you find that some of them are generated by DALLâˆ™E 2, but these images can be seen as **real** for Stable Diffusion :)
