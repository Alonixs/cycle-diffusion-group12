# Deep Learning 2 Mini-Project

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:
1. Create a Conda environment using the [environment.yml](src/cycle-diffusion) file.
2. Navigate to the [demos](demos/) folder.
3. Execute the code in the [install_dependencies.ipynb](demos/install_dependencies.ipynb) notebook.

## Experiments

The experiments conducted to answer our research questions can be found in the [demos](demos/) folder. The output for each experiment has been saved already.

- [Experiments related to research question 1](demos/RQ1_1.ipynb)
- [Experiments related to research question 2](demos/RQ1_2.ipynb)

For more detailed information about the experiments, please refer to the accompanying blog post.

## CycleDiffusion source code

As it is neccessary to download additional files not included in this repository, we refer to the instructions in [install_dependencies.ipynb](demos/install_dependencies.ipynb) and the [CycleDiffusion README](src/cycle-diffusion/README.md) for more information. This ensures a smooth reproduction of our experiments.
